### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ccacommander/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ccacommander/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteMember 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ccacommander/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `MemberListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ccacommander/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Member` and `Event` objects residing in the Model

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ccacommander/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("deleteMember 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteMember 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteMemberCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `CCACommanderParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteMemberCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteMemberCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a member).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `CcaCommanderParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `CreateMemberCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `CreateMemberCommand`) which the `CcaCommanderParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `CreateMemberCommandParser`, `DeleteMemberCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ccacommander/model/Model.java)
* The class diagram below gives an overview of the model package.<br/>
*Details of the `Member`, `Event`, and `Attendance` packages have be omitted for brevity.
Please refer to the [Member](#member-class-diagram), [Event](#event-class-diagram) and [Attendance](#attendance-class-diagram) diagrams for more information.*

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the CCACommander data i.e., all `Member` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueMemberList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Member` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Member>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)



### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ccacommander/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both CCACommander data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `CcaCommanderStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.ccacommander.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Attendance Model
This section explains how the `Attendance` model is implemented and the various design consideration when
implementing this model.

#### Implementation
The `Attendance` and `UniqueAttendanceList` classes are implemented as shown in the diagram below:

![AttendanceClassDiagram](images/AttendanceClassDiagram.png)

`Attendance` encapsulates the attendance of an event by a member. It composes of the `Name` of the member and
the `Name` of the event enrolled in, number of `Hours` they contributed, and a `Remark` to note for that
attendance. `UniqueAttendanceList` stores all unique instances of `Attendance`.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to store each member's events and each event's members.**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the attendance as an independent list.
  * Pros:
    * Easy to implement.
    * Less performance issues when loading and storing attendances.
  * Cons:
    * Incur high performance cost when viewing members of event or events of member.

* **Alternative 2:** Each member or event has its own list of attendances.
  * Pros:
    * Linear time to view members of event or events of members.
  * Cons:
    * Hard to implement.
    * Will encounter more difficulties when implementing other features related to attendance.

Alternative 1 was chosen as the benefit of having a simple design outweighs the cost of having a higher
performance overhead when viewing members of event or events of member. Alternative 2 has multiple layers of
complexities that are difficult to navigate and this will compound when dealing with other features related to
attendance. The simpler design of alternative 1 also allows for more rigorous testing.

### Enrol Feature
The enrol feature allows users to link a member to an event in order to keep track of their attendance and contributions to the event.

This section will explain how the enrol feature was implemented and the various design considerations when implementing the feature.

#### Implementation
The enrolment mechanism is facilitated by `EnrolCommand`. It extends `Command`.
The method, `EnrolCommand#execute(Model model)`, performs a validity check and adds a member's attendance for a particular event if
all the supplied parameters are valid.

The sequence diagram below shows how the `Model` and `LogicManager` components interact when a `EnrolCommand` is executed with user input
`enrol m/1 e/1 h/1 r/Role: Photographer` represented by `...`

![EnrolSequenceDiagram](images/EnrolSequenceDiagram.png)

1. `LogicManager` uses the `CcaCommanderParser` class to parse the user command, creating a new instance of `EnrolCommandParser` object.
2. The `EnrolCommandParser` creates a new instance of a `EnrolCommand` object and returns it to `CcaCommanderParser`
1. `CcaCommanderParser` encapsulates the `EnrolCommand` object as a `Command` object which is executed by
   the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution calls `Model#getFilteredMemberList()` and `Model#getFilteredEventList()` to get the desired `member` and
   `event` respectively using indexes supplied by the user.
1. Next, the command execution creates a new instance of an `Attendance` object.
1. `Model#createAttendance()` is then called, adding the new `Attendance` object to the `uniqueAttendanceList` object in `model`.
1. The change resulting from the command's execution is saved using the `Model#commit()` method for the `undo`/`redo` feature.
1. A `CommandResult` object which encapsulates the result of the command execution is passed back to the `Ui`.

The following activity diagram shows how the `EnrolCommand` works.

![EnrolActivityDiagram](images/EnrolActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect 1: `EnrolCommand` parameters

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `EnrolCommand` has parameters `Name memberName`, `Name eventName`, `Hours hours` and `Remark remark`.
    * Pros:
        * Less complex code reduces the possibility of bugs.
        * Reduced coupling, enhancing maintainability
    * Cons:
        * Not standardised with other creation commands.

* **Alternative 2:** `EnrolCommand` has parameter `Attendance attendance`
    * Pros:
        * Standardised with other creation commands
    * Cons:
        * More complex code leading to higher possibility of bugs.
        * Increased coupling, reducing maintainability.

Alternative 1 was chosen because the cons of implementing alternative 2 outweighs the benefits derived from it. Alternative 2
would require `EnrolCommandParser` to have knowledge of the `Model`. This would result in an increased coupling as it would
then have greater dependence on more modules. Hence, while Alternative 1 would result in the `EnrolCommand` to be not standardised
with other create commands, it provides a simpler implementation with fewer changes needed while also maintaining ease of testing.

### Undo/Redo Feature

The Undo/Redo feature allows the user to revert commands that were entered wrongly.

This section will explain how the redo and undo features were implemented and the various design considerations when implementing the feature.

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedCcaCommander`. It extends `CcaCommander` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `ccaCommanderVersionList` and `versionPointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedCcaCommander#commit(String commitMessage)`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current CCACommander version and its commit message in its history.
* `VersionedCcaCommander#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous CCACommander version from its history.
* `VersionedCcaCommander#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone CCACommander version from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commit()`, `Model#undo()` and `Model#redo()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedCcaCommander` will be initialized with the initial CCACommander version, and the `versionPointer` pointing to that single CCACommander version. This initial CCACommander version will be saved into the `ccaCommanderVersionList`

![UndoRedoVersion0](images/UndoRedoVersion0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `deleteMember 5` command to delete the 5th member in CCACommander. The `deleteMember` command calls `Model#commit(String commitMessage)`, causing the modified version of the CCACommander after the `deleteMember 5` command executes to be saved in the `ccaCommanderVersionList`, and the `versionPointer` is shifted to the newly inserted CCACommander version.

![UndoRedoVersion1](images/UndoRedoVersion1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `createMember n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new member. The `createMember` command also calls `Model#commit(String commitMessage)`, causing another modified CCACommander version to be saved into the `ccaCommanderVersionList`.

![UndoRedoVersion2](images/UndoRedoVersion2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commit(String commitMessage)`, so the CCACommander version will not be saved into the `ccaCommanderVersionList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the member was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will shift the `versionPointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous CCACommander version, and restores the CCACommander to that version.

![UndoRedoVersion3](images/UndoRedoVersion3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `versionPointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial CcaCommander version, then there are no previous CcaCommander versions to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redo()`, which shifts the `versionPointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone version, and restores CCACommander to that version.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `versionPointer` is at index `ccaCommanderVersionList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest CCACommander version, then there are no undone CcaCommander versions to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedo()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the CCACommander, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commit(String commitMessage)`, `Model#undo()` or `Model#redo()`. Thus, the `ccaCommanderVersionList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoVersion4](images/UndoRedoVersion4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commit(String commitMessage)`. Since the `versionPointer` is not pointing at the end of the `ccaCommanderVersionList`, all CCACommander versions after the `versionPointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `createMember n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoVersion5](images/UndoRedoVersion5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire CCACommander.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deleteMember`, just save the member being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


### [Proposed] Command History

#### Implementation
The proposed commandHistory mechanism is facilitated by `CommandHistory`. It contains `commandHistoryList` and `currentCommandPointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:
* `CommandHistory#hasPreviousCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns if there is a previously command from the history based on `currentCommandPointer`.
* `CommandHistory#hasNextCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns if there is a next command from the history based on `currentCommandPointer`.
* `CommandHistory#getPreviousCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous command from its history based on `currentCommandPointer`.
* `CommandHistory#getNextCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the next command from its history based on `currentCommandPointer`.
* `CommandHistory#addCommand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Add the command into the history.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the commandHistory behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time and enters their first command. 
The `CommandHistory` will save the command and the `currentCommandPointer` won't be pointing to any command.

![CommandHistoryState0](images/CommandHistoryState0.png)

Step 2. The user presses 'â†‘' while the commandBox is selected. `CommandHistory#getPreviousCommand()` is called and the previous command is displayed in the commandBox. 
When the previous command is entered into the commandBox, the newly edited version of command will not be stored in `CommandHistory`.

![CommandHistoryState1](images/CommandHistoryState1.png)

Step 3. The user presses 'â†‘' while the commandBox is selected. `CommandHistory#getPreviousCommand()` is called 
and the previous command is displayed in the commandBox. When the previous command is edited and is entered into the commandBox, the newly edited version of command will be stored in `CommandHistory` after calling `CommandHistory#addCommand()`.

![CommandHistoryState3](images/CommandHistoryState2.png)

Step 4. The user has pressed 'â†‘' while selecting the commandBox until the first Command and `CommandHistory#getPreviousCommand()` 
is called multiple times. The user then presses 'â†“' and `CommandHistory#getNextCommand()` is called and the command1 (the next command) will then be displayed in the commandBox.

![CommandHistoryState3](images/CommandHistoryState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentCommandPointer` is at 
index 0, pointing to the initial first command, then there are no previous commands to restore. The program uses 
`CommandHistory#hasPreviousCommand()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will not change anything.

</div>


The opposite occurs too when calling the next command â€‰â€”â€‰ the program calls `CommandHistory#hasNextCommand()`, which shifts the `currentCommandPointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously entered command and displaying that command instead.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `commandHistoryPointer` is at index `commandHistoryList.size()`, pointing to nothing, and there are no undone CcaCommander states to restore. 
The program uses `CommandHistory#hasNextCommand()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will not change anything.

</div>


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommandHistoryActivityDiagram.png" width="400" style="padding-left:170px" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Storing of Command History:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores the list of all commands.
    * Pros: Allows user to iterate through all commands listed.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** CommandHistory only stores previous command.
    * Pros: Will use less memory and reduces user error.
    * Cons: Quite limited as a feature.
